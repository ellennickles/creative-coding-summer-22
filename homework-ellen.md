## Homework Guidelines
Assignments are **due by 8:00am ET the day of our class** so I have a chance to review your questions before we meet. All assignments are expected to be submitted by the stated deadline. If you anticipate any challenges meeting the deadline, please reach out to me so that we can consider your options together.

A big part of learning in the IMA Low Res program is learning from each other. Share your work and in return you'll see everyone else's!

- **Weekly Worksheet.** There are worksheets (linked below) to practice the concepts introduced in this course. You are expected to add links to your p5 sketches directly tp these documents*. 
- <strong>Weekly Exercise and Blog Post.**</strong> Each week there is an open-ended exercise to apply the concepts that we practice. You are expected to add links to your blog posts directly to the weekly exercise documents* (linked below). **Include a link to your p5 sketch in your blog post and answer these questions:**
    - What did you do?
    - What worked?
    - What didn’t work, and what steps did you take to try to solve the issue?
    - Did any code-related questions come up for you?

\*Log in to your NYU account to access the documents.

\**If you are struggling with your weekly exercise sketches, put your energy into writing about what didn't work and how you tried to solve it. It is totally okay to vent your frustrations. Writing a blog post helps to remember and synthesize what you did and tried to do. Think of it as writing a reference guide for your future self.

    - Submit your "self portrait" sketch [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8PWe7tYTqlKARpk3FE0J8gkbMGzK6skOoMTXc8hTsQ/edit#heading=h.7hcg69t05zcn). We'll look at them in the first class!
