## Homework Guidelines
Assignments are **due by 6:00am ET the day of our class** so I have a chance to review your questions before we meet. All assignments are expected to be submitted by the stated deadline. If you anticipate any challenges meeting the deadline, please reach out to me so that we can consider your options together.

A big part of learning in the IMA Low Res program is learning from each other. Share your work and in return you'll see everyone else's!

- **Weekly Worksheet.** There are worksheets (linked below) to practice the concepts introduced in this course. You are expected to add links to your p5.js (p5) sketches directly tp these documents*. 
- <strong>Weekly Exercise and Blog Post.**</strong> Each week there is an open-ended exercise to apply the concepts that we practice. You are expected to add links to your blog posts directly to the weekly exercise documents* (linked below). **Include a link to your p5 sketch in your blog post and answer these questions:**
    - What did you do?
    - What worked?
    - What didn’t work, and what steps did you take to try to solve the issue?
    - Did any code-related questions come up for you?

\*Log in to your NYU account to access the documents.

\**If you are struggling with your weekly exercise sketches, put your energy into writing about what didn't work and how you tried to solve it. It is totally okay to vent your frustrations. Writing a blog post helps to remember and synthesize what you did and tried to do. Think of it as writing a reference guide for your future self.

- [Ellen's portrait animated](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/sketches/ZkpJWuMRx)

**Homework assignment due Mon July 19:**
- TEST YOURSELF • Complete questions 3-6 in [Worksheet 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3DCZA0-i6TPl9On5APDRa1FetS5aswDNQwsvJlnlYU/edit?usp=sharing)

- CREATE • How can we start to make our sketches expressive in different ways? Experiment with a sketch that includes all of these: 
    - One element controlled by the mouse.
    - One element that changes over time, independently of the mouse.
    - One element that is different every time you run the sketch.
    - For example, you could try refactoring your Pre-Work Assignment (self-portrait) sketch by removing all the hard-coded numbers except for `createCanvas()`. Have some of the elements follow the mouse. Have some move independently. Have some move at random. Or you could do the above but change color, alpha, and/or strokeWeight instead of position. Or do something completely different!
    - (OPTIONAL) If you feel comfortable with variables and coding in general, consider how other types of user input might open up additional avenues to suggest meaning. For example, what are the possibilities if your sketch is responsive to sound or [body](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/posenet) / [face](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/facemesh) / [hand](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/handpose) movement?
    - Write a blog post that includes a link to your sketch.

**Homework assignment due Mon July 26:**
- TEST YOURSELF • Complete the new questions in [Worksheet 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T3KRtx1Nu44asoi8Rek-3IsknmS7FWszkN3yUE2nrC4/edit?usp=sharing)
- CREATE • What repeats in your life or is cyclical? What patterns do you find in nature, architecture, textiles, conversations? Make a sketch with a lot of repetition, more than you want to hand-code. Can you make your sketch responsive to mouse behavior or key presses? Some ideas to get started:
    - You might take a previous sketch with a lot of repetition, and re-write it with a loop. For example, instead of needing 30 lines of code to call `rect()`, call `rect()` once inside of a loop that goes around 30 times. Look for a pattern. How do you need to rework the way you position that `rect()` inside the loop?
    - Try creating an algorithmic design with simple parameters. One example is to invent your own [10PRINT](https://10print.org/) design. See [Coding Train Coding Challenge: 10PRINT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyTZ5ZZxZs&vl=en) and the [example code](https://gist.github.com/shiffman/e683b93f5600dbb7495f). A related source of inspiration: [Sol Lewitt's Wall Drawings](https://massmoca.org/sol-lewitt/).
    - Make a mini-calendar. Use iteration to render a row of visual elements for each of the days of the current month. All of the elements should be drawn identically, except for the one whose index corresponds to the current day. Differentiate this element in some way. Consider using p5's [`day()` function](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/day). (Source: _Code as a Creative Medium_.)
    - Write a blog post that includes a link to your sketch.
    - [Submit your post here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VrXGEk_hTCX1jqMX8gBHo_-_1o55DJ6dYFRxxfeCKFk/edit).
- WATCH • [Coding Train Videos 5.1-5.2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) about functions and [Videos 7.1-7.2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) about arrays ~50 min

___

### **// Class 2 • Wed July 28 • Functions**

**In class:**

    - Writing functions
    - Calling them with and without arguments
- Creative coding examples

**Examples:**
- [Generative Design book](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/)

- [Ellen's Zoom background](https://editor.p5js.org/enickles/sketches/rEut1IfjU)

**Tips for learning / debugging code:**
- Keep the code library reference open in a nearby tab.
- Only learn one thing at a time.
- Similar: if there’s a lot of code you don’t understand, focus on figuring out one small piece at a time (ignore the rest if you can).
- Go as slow as you need to!
- Sketch out your idea or write it out in plain language before translating it into code.
- If you’re not sure what something does in the code, comment it out to see if you get a different result.
- If you are not sure about the impact of a value, try making it a really small number or a really large number.
- Explain the code out loud to someone… or to Vince's duck.
- Print variables to the console to read the values instead of trying to imagine them in your head.
- Ask! [How to ask code-related questions](https://github.com/ellennickles/creative-coding-summer-21/blob/main/example-code-questions.md)
- If you're still stuck, go outside / get a snack / do something else. 

**Homework assignment due Mon Aug 2:**
- TEST YOURSELF • Complete the new questions in [Worksheet 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ym-zlbP-xMsYH4q3kVW11Uq0JS8CRSh2KchWY18INiY/edit?usp=sharing)
- CREATE • We can organize our code into discrete code blocks, functions, to reuse over and over, such as to create different expressions of similar elements (e.g. position, size, speed, color). The idea for next week is to practice writing and using your own functions. 
    - It is 100% legitimate to turn in a version of a previous assignment where nothing changes for the end user, but the code has been restructured (refactored) into functions. 
    - You can also try a new experiment from scratch! For example, can you draw a landscape of varying plants by calling the “plant function” with different arguments? Or create a family of varying creatures? Or draw the same design multiple times but with different characteristics? 
    - For either option, aim to keep `setup()` and `draw()` as clean as possible, and do everything (all calculations, drawing, etc.) in functions that you create yourself. Try to incorporate the following:
        - Break the code out of `setup()` and `draw()` into functions.
        - Call at least one of your functions multiple times with different arguments.
        - For anything that repeats and you notice a pattern, use a loop to make it happen.
    - Write a blog post that includes a link to your sketch.
    - [Submit your post here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1niO3xN_NNvP1Zlr4AvxxwncpCm2ZkmCsASIn3VGVwW4/edit).

- WATCH (OPTIONAL) • [Coding Train Videos 7.6-7.7](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) about objects communicating with each other ~30 min
