## Weekly Assignment Guidelines
All assignments will be posted on this page, and all are required. Unless otherwise stated, assignments are **due by 8:00am ET the day of our class** so that I have a chance to review your questions before we meet. All assignments are expected to be submitted by the stated deadline. If you anticipate any challenges meeting the deadline, please reach out to me so that we can consider your options together.

There are programming exercises and tutorials to complete each week:
- **Reading and Video Tutorials** • Before class, read and/or watch the assigned tutorials about fundamental coding concepts and creative programming techniques to practice together when we meet in class.
- **Practice Questions** • These questions are an opportunity to practice the concepts introduced in class. You are expected to add links to your p5 sketches directly to the weekly assignment document* (linked below).
- <strong>Creative Exercise and Blog Post</strong>** • Each week there is an open-ended exercise to apply the concepts that we practice. You are expected to add links to your blog posts directly to the the weekly assignment document. Include a link to your p5 sketch in your blog post and answer these questions:
    - What did you do?
    - What worked?
    - What didn’t work, and what steps did you take to try to solve the issue?
    - Did any code-related questions come up for you?
    - Be sure to [cite](https://github.com/ellennickles/creative-coding-summer-22#statement-on-the-use-of-free-and-open-source-materials-including-code) any sources that you used.

A big part of learning in the IMA Low Res program is learning from each other. Share your work and in return you'll see everyone else's!

\**If you are struggling with the weekly exercises, put your energy into writing about what didn't work and how you tried to solve it. It is totally okay to vent your frustrations. Writing a blog post can help synthesize what you did and tried to do. Think of it as writing a reference guide for your future self.


## Pre-Work Assignment and Drawing in p5
