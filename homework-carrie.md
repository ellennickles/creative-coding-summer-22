## Week 00: Drawing in p5.js
————————————————————————————

***To be completed before Saturday, July 9th.***
* Watch: [Coding Train videos 1.1-1.6](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)
* Log in to the [p5 web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).
* Create a “self-portrait”. Think about what a self-portrait means to you. Is it a depiction of what you look like? A bridge between your private and public regard? Or a collection of your lived experiences?  
* Consult the [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/). Add comments to your code to describe the different parts.
* **Submit your "self portrait" sketch [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GPHaEj6L248FUTG789Mc7G95FAdmmJfHeAVldJb5jbg/edit?usp=sharing). We'll look at them in the first class!**
