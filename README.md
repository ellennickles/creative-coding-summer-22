## Description
This is a hands-on introduction to programming the computer for creative applications. This course will introduce computational thinking and explore fundamental coding concepts, such as order of operations, logic sequencing, data structures, data flow, and event-driven interactions in the context of screen-based projects. Iterative assignments will facilitate the development of a final creative code-driven experience. The open source, JavaScript-based [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) (p5) programming framework for creative coding is the primary vehicle for the class using the [web editor for p5](https://editor.p5js.org/). Both sections assume no programming experience at all.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this course, we will be able to:
* describe possibilities of computational thinking and coding for creative applications;
* recognize p5 as a Javascript framework for drawing graphics and working with media on the HTML Canvas element of a web page;
* identify fundamental coding concepts, such as variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, arrays, and objects;
* identify approaches to debug errors in our code, including how to interpret error messages and print messages to the Console of the p5 web editor;
* practice and apply these coding concepts and debugging approaches in our creative work using p5.

## Community Guidelines
Following [NYU's Student Conduct Policies](https://tinyurl.com/scpnyu) and the [IMA Low Res Rules of Play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QH9lqtzUl8qOX9goJIKEmvMUpfPgLjRJpKm-UPPnFHs/edit#heading=h.4qxpmfter73o), we are committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space for everyone in the community. Harassment or discrimination in any form will not be tolerated, and this applies to any interactions and content in all IMA Low Res spaces including but not limited to the NYU IMA Low Res Creative Coding Summer 2021 classes.

## Structure and Teaching Methodology
This is a 5-week course that meets twice a week, synchronously in Zoom. There are assignments to do before each class, and these assignments will build towards a final project that we will present at the end of the semester.

This course embraces an active-learning approach with the belief that programming is best understood by doing. In keeping with this approach, class time will be structured as a workshop and seminar instead of a lecture, relying heavily on group discussion and participation. Weekly video tutorials to watch before class sessions will introduce fundamental coding concepts. During class, supplemental code examples will be presented and discussed before hands-on work together. Time will also be allotted to share weekly assignments. Examples and assignments will iteratively build upon lessons learned in preceding classes.  

You are encouraged to reach out to the instructors outside of class to ask questions, share ideas/feedback, and discuss topics in detail.


## Assignments and Final Project
### Weekly Assignments 
* Before class, watch the video tutorials about the fundamental coding concepts to practice together when we meet.
* There are also weekly programming assignments that are relevant to the material from previous classes. Each week will include a series of practice questions and one open-ended exercise to apply the concepts that we practice in class. The assignments are required, and you should be prepared to show and talk about them in class. 
* Submit your weekly programming assignments by the following deadlines:
    * For Section 1 with Ellen, submit by 8:00am ET the day of our class.
    * For Section 2 with Carrie, submit by 10:00am ET the day of our class. 

### Final Project
* The course will culminate with the completion of a final project to share in class. 
* You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that builds off or is inspired by the concepts covered during the semester. 
* You are welcome to combine your final project for this class with a final project from another class.

## Evaluation
This class uses a Pass/Fail grading system. A Pass is equivalent to an A or a B grade, and anything less is considered a Fail.

Grades will be determined according to this criteria:
* Regular Assignments 40%
* Participation and Attendance 40%
* Final Project 20%

This class is participatory. You are expected to contribute to discussions and provide feedback to other students in class, which includes engaging with their assignments and projects. This, along with attendance, is 40% of your grade.

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. Please email your instructor if you are going to miss a class. Two unexcused absences are cause for failing the class. An unexcused lateness of 10 minutes or more is equivalent to 1/2 of an absence.

## Statements

### Statement of Academic Integrity
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

### Statement of Principle
The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice.  Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards.  For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the [Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook](https://tisch.nyu.edu/student-affairs/important-resources/tisch-policies-and-handbooks).

At NYU Shanghai, a commitment to excellence, fairness, honesty, and respect within and outside the classroom is essential to maintaining the integrity of our community. By accepting membership in this community, students take responsibility for demonstrating these values in their own conduct and for recognizing and supporting these values in others. In turn, these values will create a campus climate that encourages the free exchange of ideas, promotes scholarly excellence through active and creative thought, and allows community members to achieve and be recognized for achieving their highest potential.

### Statement on the Use of Free and Open Source Materials (including code)
***This statement is adapted from Dan Shiffman’s [Code! Course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18UjdDrXUMKgNjIiee9d2WeyV1Z8V1RfBEElkzWKXvbk/edit#) (Spring 2020) at New York University and Golan Levin’s [Interactivity and Computation Course](http://cmuems.com/2018/60212f/syllabus/academic-integrity/) (Fall 2018) at Carnegie Mellon University.***

**You must cite the source of any material / code you use** with the exception of examples specifically provided by the instructors or demonstrated in media assets for the program courses. Please note the following additional expectations and guidelines:

**Check the License.** When using others' code, pay attention to the license under which it has been released, and be certain to fulfill the terms and requirements of those licenses. Descriptions of common licenses, and their requirements, can be found at [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/). Some licenses may require permission. If you are confused or aren’t sure how to credit code, ask one of the course instructors and make your best good faith effort.

**Use Libraries.** The use of general, repurposable libraries is strongly encouraged. The people who developed and contributed these components to the community worked hard, often for no pay; acknowledge them by citing their name and linking to their repository.

**Be Careful.** It sometimes happens that an artist places the entire source code for their sketch or artwork online, as a resource from which others can learn. Assignments professors give in new-media arts courses are often similar; you may also discover the work of a student in some other class or school, who has posted code for a project which responds to a similar assignment. You should probably avoid this code. At the very least, you should be careful about approaching such code for possible re-use. If it is necessary to do so, it is best to extract components that solve a specific technical problem, rather than those parts which operate to create a poetic experience. Your challenge, if and/or when you work with others' code, is to make it your own. It should be clear that downloading an artwork from someone's GitHub and simply changing the colors would be disgracefully lazy. And doing so without proper citation would be outright plagiarism.

### Statement on Accessibility
Please feel free to make suggestions to your instructor about ways in which this class could become more accessible to you. Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities.
